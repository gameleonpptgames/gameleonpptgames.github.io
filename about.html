    <h2>About</h2>
    <p> Hi, my name is Elizabeth and I moved abroad to South Korea to teach English in 2021. I created Gameleon to provide fun, fast, and free PowerPoint game templates for foreign
        language educators. The game templates are for educational, non-commercial purposes only. They are unoffical and designed for personal use only. I decided to share the games 
        that I utilize for my classroom lesson plans as a way to give back to the ESL/EFL teaching community. All the resources that were immediately available for me to use when I first
        started teaching helped me tremendously and I wanted to create an additional online resource for incoming and current teachers. These online resources were the inspiration for
        me to code Gameleon from scratch so that I could also start a collection of the games that my students really enjoy to play in the classroom. These games templates are easily-editable 
        and free to download. <br><br> 
        The game templates included in Gameleon are all designed to encourage student interactive participation while also providing immersive game features. The goal is to help the students 
        anticipation to attend class be a positive feeling. The design and features have successfully helped previous students get excited about learning the lesson topics, and so, that is the reason why 
        I have included them in Gameleon. The games are intended to not only help teachers incorporate new ideas with the games in their lesson planning but to also motivate students to continue to 
        learn outside of the classroom. To help them realize that learning a new language does not have to be boring and difficult but that it can be fun and simple with the right tools and guidance.
